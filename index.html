	   <h3>Few words of comment : </h3>
		<p>The main purpose of crafting this game was to show our knowledge of C++ and abilities in 3d programming. 
			It's still in early stage, yet we work hard on it. 
			We used Ogre3d engine to render graphics, 3d models are taken from Turbosquid.com. Everything else is written by us.</p>
